<p>19 May 2009 - San Francisco</p>
<p>Git is a simple, but extremely powerful system. Most people try to teach
Git by demonstrating a few dozen commands and then yelling “tadaaaaa.” I
believe this method is flawed. Such a treatment may leave you with the
ability to use Git to perform simple tasks, but the Git commands will
still feel like magical incantations. Doing anything out of the ordinary
will be terrifying. Until you understand the concepts upon which Git is
built, you&#8217;ll feel like a stranger in a foreign land.</p>
<p>The following parable will take you on a journey through the creation of
a Git-like system from the ground up. Understanding the concepts
presented here will be the most valuable thing you can do to prepare
yourself to harness the full power of Git. The concepts themselves are
quite simple, but allow for an amazing wealth of functionality to spring
into existence. Read this parable all the way through and you should
have very little trouble mastering the various Git commands and wielding
the awesome power that Git makes available to you.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-parable">
<h2>The Parable<a class="headerlink" href="#the-parable" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Imagine that you have a computer that has nothing on it but a text
editor and a few file system commands. Now imagine that you have decided
to write a large software program on this system. Because you&#8217;re a
responsible software developer, you decide that you need to invent some
sort of method for keeping track of versions of your software so that
you can retrieve code that you previously changed or deleted. What
follows is a story about how you might design one such version control
system (VCS) and the reasoning behind those design choices.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="snapshots">
<h2>Snapshots<a class="headerlink" href="#snapshots" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Alfred is a friend of yours that works down at the mall as a
photographer in one of those “Special Moments” photo boutiques. All day
long he takes photos of little kids posing awkwardly in front of jungle
or ocean backdrops. During one of your frequent lunches at the pretzel
stand, Alfred tells you a story about a woman named Hazel who brings her
daughter in for a portrait every year on the same day. “She brings the
photos from all the past years with her,” Alfred tells you. “She likes
to remember what her daughter was like at each different stage, as if
the snapshots really let her move back and forth in time to those saved
memories.”</p>
<p>Like some sort of formulaic plot device, Alfred&#8217;s innocent statement
acts as a catalyst for you to see the ideal solution to your version
control dilemma. Snapshots, like save points in a video game, are really
what you care about when you need to interact with a VCS. What if you
could take snapshots of your codebase at any time and resurrect that
code on demand? Alfred reads the dawning realization spreading across
your face and knows you&#8217;re about to leave him without another word to go
back and implement whatever genius idea he just caused you to have. You
do not disappoint him.</p>
<p>You start your project in a directory named working:</p>
<img alt="_images/gp-working.png" src="_images/gp-working.png" />
<p>As you code, you try to write one feature at a time. When you complete a
self-contained portion of a feature, you make sure that all your files are saved
and then make a copy of the entire working directory, giving it the name
snapshot-0. After you perform this copy operation, you make sure to never again
change the code files in the new directory. After the next chunk of work, you
perform another copy, only this time the new directory gets the name snapshot-1,
and so on.</p>
<img alt="_images/gp-snapshot1.png" src="_images/gp-snapshot1.png" />
<p>To make it easy to remember what changes you made in each snapshot, you
add a special file named message to each snapshot directory that
contains a summary of the work that you did and the date of completion.
By printing the contents of each message, it becomes easy to find a
specific change that you made in the past, in case you need to resurrect
some old code.</p>
<img alt="_images/gp-messages.png" src="_images/gp-messages.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="branches">
<h2>Branches<a class="headerlink" href="#branches" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>After a bit of time on the project, a candidate for release begins to
emerge. Late nights at the keyboard finally yield snapshot-99, the
nascent form of what will become Release Version 1.0. It comes to pass
that this snapshot is packaged and distributed to the eagerly awaiting
masses.</p>
<img alt="_images/gp-release.png" src="_images/gp-release.png" />
<p>Stoked by excellent response to your software, you push forward,
determined to make the next version an even bigger success.</p>
<img alt="_images/gp-progress.png" src="_images/gp-progress.png" />
<p>Your VCS has so far been a faithful companion. Old versions of your code
are there when you need them and can be accessed with ease. But not long
after the release, bug reports start to come in.</p>
<img alt="_images/gp-bugs.png" src="_images/gp-bugs.png" />
<p>Nobody&#8217;s perfect, you reassure yourself, and snapshot-99 is readily retrievable,
glad to be brought back to life for the purposes of applying bug fixes.</p>
<p>Since the release, you&#8217;ve created 10 new snapshots. This new work must
not be included in the 1.0.1 bug fix version you now need to create. To
solve this, you copy snapshot-99 to working so that your working
directory is at exactly the point where Version 1.0 was released.</p>
<img alt="_images/gp-checkout-release.png" src="_images/gp-checkout-release.png" />
<p>A few swift lines of code and the bug is fixed in the working directory.</p>
<p>It is here that a problem becomes apparent. The VCS deals very well with
linear development, but for the first time ever, you need to create a
new snapshot that is not a direct descendent of the preceding snapshot.
If you create a snapshot-110 (remember that you created 10 snapshots
since the release), then you&#8217;ll be interrupting the linear flow and will
have no way of determining the ancestry of any given snapshot.</p>
<img alt="_images/gp-post-release.png" src="_images/gp-post-release.png" />
<p>Clearly, you need something more powerful than a linear system.</p>
<p>Studies show that even short exposures to nature can help recharge the
mind&#8217;s creative potential. You&#8217;ve been sitting behind the artificially
polarized light of your monitor for days on end. A walk through the
woods in the brisk Autumn air will do you some good and with any luck,
will help you arrive at an ideal solution to your problem.</p>
<p>The great oaks that line the trail have always appealed to you. They
seem to stand stark and proud against the perfectly blue sky. Half the
ruddy leaves have departed from their branches, leaving an intricate
pattern of branches in their wake. Fixating on one of the thousands of
branch tips you idly try to follow it back to the solitary trunk. This
organically produced structure allows for such great complexity, but the
rules for finding your way back to the trunk are so simple, and perfect
for keeping track of multiple lines of development! It turns out that
what they say about nature and creativity are true.</p>
<p>By looking at your code history as a tree, solving the problem of
ancestry becomes trivial.</p>
<img alt="_images/gp-commit-tree.png" src="_images/gp-commit-tree.png" />
<p>All you need to do is include the name of the parent snapshot in the message
file you write for each snapshot. Adding just a single upstream pointer will
enable you to easily and accurately trace the history of any given snapshot
all the way back to the root.</p>
<img alt="_images/gp-parents.png" src="_images/gp-parents.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="branch-names">
<h2>Branch Names<a class="headerlink" href="#branch-names" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Your code history is now a tree. Instead of having a single latest
snapshot, you have two: one for each branch. With a linear system, your
sequential numbering system let you easily identify the latest snapshot.
Now, that ability is lost.</p>
<p>Creating new development branches has become so simple that you&#8217;ll want
to take advantage of it all the time. You&#8217;ll be creating branches for
fixes to old releases, for experiments that may not pan out; indeed it
becomes possible to create a new branch for every feature you begin!</p>
<p>But like everything good in life, there is a price to be paid. Each time
you create a new snapshot, you must remember that the new snapshot
becomes the latest on its branch. Without this information, switching to
a new branch would become a laborious process indeed.</p>
<p>Every time you create a new branch you probably give it a name in your
head. “This will be the Version 1.0 Maintenance Branch,” you might say.
Perhaps you refer to the former linear branch as the “master” branch.</p>
<img alt="_images/gp-branch-names.png" src="_images/gp-branch-names.png" />
<p>Think about this a little further, though. From the perspective of a
tree, what does it mean to name a branch? Naming every snapshot that
appears in the history of a branch would do the trick, but requires the
storage of a potentially large amount of data. Additionally, it still
wouldn&#8217;t help you efficiently locate the latest snapshot on a branch.</p>
<p>The least amount of information necessary to identify a branch is the
location of the latest snapshot on that branch. If you need to know the
list of snapshots that are part of the branch you can easily trace the
parentage.</p>
<p>Storing the branch names is trivial. In a file named branches, stored
outside of any specific snapshot, you simply list the name/snapshot
pairs that represent the tips of branches. To switch to a named branch
you need only look up the snapshot for the corresponding name from this
file.</p>
<img alt="_images/gp-branch-file.png" src="_images/gp-branch-file.png" />
<p>Because you&#8217;re only storing the latest snapshot on each branch, creating
a new snapshot now contains an additional step. If the new snapshot is
being created as part of a branch, the branches file must be updated so
that the name of the branch becomes associated with the new snapshot. A
small price to pay for the benefit.</p>
<img alt="_images/gp-update-branch.png" src="_images/gp-update-branch.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="tags">
<h2>Tags<a class="headerlink" href="#tags" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>After using branches for a while you notice that they can serve two
purposes. First, they can act as movable pointers to snapshots so that
you can keep track of the branch tips. Second, they can be pointed at a
single snapshot and never move.</p>
<p>The first use case allows you to keep track of ongoing development,
things like “Release Maintenance”. The second case is useful for
labeling points of interest, like “Version 1.0” and “Version 1.0.1”.</p>
<p>Mixing both of these uses into a single file feels messy. Both types are
pointers to snapshots, but one moves and one doesn&#8217;t. For the sake of
clarity and elegance, you decide to create another file called tags to
contain pointers of the second type.</p>
<img alt="_images/gp-tags.png" src="_images/gp-tags.png" />
<p>Keeping these two inherently different pointers in separate files will
help you from accidentally treating a branch as a tag or vice versa.</p>

</div>
<p>You don&#8217;t realize it, but you are soon going to need some good unique
identifiers to use for your snapshots.  Luckily you know about <em>hashes</em>.</p>
<p>For background on hashes : <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">Wikipedia on hash
functions</a>.</p>
<p>A <em>hash</em> is the result of running a <em>hash function</em> over a block of
data. The hash is a fixed length string that is the <em>fingerprint</em> of that
exact block of data. For example, let&#8217;s say you had a text file called
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">my_file</span></tt> with exactly this text as its contents:
return):</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>git is a rude word in UK English
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>(The sentence has a carriage return at the end). You can run the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SHA1</span></tt> <em>hash
function</em> over the contents of this file (e.g. with the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">shasum</span></tt> command in
Unix), and you will get this hash value:
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">30ad6c360a692c1fe66335bb00d00e0528346be5</span></tt>.</p>
<p>Not too exciting so far. However, the rather magical nature of this string is
not yet apparent. Here&#8217;s the trick – there is no practical way for you to
find a file with different contents to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">my_file</span></tt> that will give the same hash
value.</p>
<p>The hash value then is (very nearly) completely unique to the sequence of bytes
in that file.</p>
<p>For example, a tiny change in the file makes the hash completely
different.  If you just add a full-stop at the end of the sentence:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>git is a rude word in UK English.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>– and save the file, it now has a completely different hash value,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">23d97b00299c250b43049be67c97cf2e5ffc2428</span></tt>.</p>
<p>So, I give you a file, and you calculate the hash value, and it comes out as
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">30ad6c360a692c1fe66335bb00d00e0528346be5</span></tt> then you can be very sure that the
data I gave you was exactly a file with the text &#8220;git is a rude word in UK
English&#8221; (plus a carriage return).</p>

<div class="section" id="distributed">
<h2>Distributed<a class="headerlink" href="#distributed" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Working on your own gets pretty lonely. Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if you could
invite a friend to work on your project with you? Well, you&#8217;re in luck.
Your friend Zoe has a computer setup just like yours and wants to help
with the project. Because you&#8217;ve created such a great version control
system, you tell her all about it and send her a copy of all your
snapshots, branches, and tags so she can enjoy the same benefits of the
code history.</p>
<img alt="_images/gp-zoe.png" src="_images/gp-zoe.png" />
<p>It&#8217;s great to have Zoe on the team but she has a habit of taking long
trips to far away places without internet access. As soon as she has the
source code, she catches a flight to Patagonia and you don&#8217;t hear from
her for a week. In the meantime you both code up a storm. When she
finally gets back, you discover a critical flaw in your VCS. Because
you&#8217;ve both been using the same numbering system, you each have
directories named &#8216;snapshot-114&#8217;, &#8216;snapshot-115&#8217;, and so on, but with
different contents!</p>
<img alt="_images/gp-zoes-edits.png" src="_images/gp-zoes-edits.png" />
<p>To make matters worse, you don&#8217;t even know who authored the changes in
those new snapshots. Together, you devise a plan for dealing with these
problems. First, snapshot messages will henceforth contain author name
and email.</p>
<img alt="_images/gp-authors.png" src="_images/gp-authors.png" />
<p>Second, snapshots will no longer be named with simple numbers. Instead, you&#8217;ll
use the contents of the message file to produce a hash. This hash will be
guaranteed to be unique to the snapshot since no two messages will ever have
the same date, message, parent, and author. To make sure everything goes
smoothly, you both agree to use the SHA1 hash algorithm that takes the
contents of a file and produces a 40 character hexadecimal string. You both
update your histories with the new technique and instead of clashing
&#8216;snapshot-114&#8217; directories, you now have distinct directories named
&#8216;8ba3441b6b89cad23387ee875f2ae55069291f4b&#8217; and
&#8216;db9ecb5b5a6294a8733503ab57577db96ff2249e&#8217;.</p>
<img alt="_images/gp-sha1.png" src="_images/gp-sha1.png" />
<p>With the updated naming scheme, it becomes trivial for you to fetch all
the new snapshots from Zoe&#8217;s computer and place them next to your
existing snapshots. Because every snapshot specifies its parent, and
identical messages (and therefor identical snapshots) have identical
names no matter where they are created, the history of the codebase can
still be drawn as a tree. Only now, the tree is comprised of snapshots
authored by both Zoe and you.</p>
<img alt="_images/gp-copying.png" src="_images/gp-copying.png" />
<p>This point is important enough to warrant repeating. A snapshot is
identified by a SHA1 that uniquely identifies it (and its parent). These
snapshots can be created and moved around between computers without
losing their identity or where they belong in the history tree of a
project. What&#8217;s more, snapshots can be shared or kept private as you see
fit. If you have some experimental snapshots that you want to keep to
yourself, you can do so quite easily. Just don&#8217;t make them available to
Zoe!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="offline">
<h2>Offline<a class="headerlink" href="#offline" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Zoe&#8217;s travel habits cause her to spend countless hours on airplanes and
boats. Most of the places she visits have no readily available internet
access. At the end of the day, she spends more time offline than online.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no surprise, then, that Zoe raves about your VCS. All of the day to
day operations that she needs to do can be done locally. The only time
she needs a network connection is when she&#8217;s ready to share her
snapshots with you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="merges">
<h2>Merges<a class="headerlink" href="#merges" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Before Zoe left on her trip, you had asked her to start working off of
the branch named &#8216;math&#8217; and to implement a function that generated prime
numbers. Meanwhile, you were also developing off of the &#8216;math&#8217; branch,
only you were writing a function to generate magic numbers.</p>
<img alt="_images/gp-before-merge.png" src="_images/gp-before-merge.png" />
<p>Now that Zoe has returned, you are faced with the task of merging these two
separate branches of development into a single snapshot.</p>
<img alt="_images/gp-merge-problem.png" src="_images/gp-merge-problem.png" />
<p>Since you both worked on separate tasks, the merge is simple. While
constructing the snapshot message for the merge, you realize that this
snapshot is special.  Instead of just a single parent, this merge snapshot has
two parents!  The first parent is your latest on the &#8216;math&#8217; branch and the
second parent is Zoe&#8217;s latest on her &#8216;math&#8217; branch. The merge snapshot doesn&#8217;t
contain any changes beyond those necessary to merge the two disparate parents
into a single codebase.</p>
<img alt="_images/gp-after-merge.png" src="_images/gp-after-merge.png" />
<p>Once you complete the merge, Zoe fetches all the snapshots that you have
that she does not, which include your development on the &#8216;math&#8217; branch
and your merge snapshot. Once she does this, both of your histories
match exactly!</p>
<img alt="_images/gp-sync-merge.png" src="_images/gp-sync-merge.png" />

<div class="section" id="rewriting-history">
<h2>Rewriting History<a class="headerlink" href="#rewriting-history" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Like many software developers you have a compulsion to keep your code
clean and very well organized. This carries over into a desire to keep
your code history well groomed. Last night you came home after having a
few too many pints of Guinness at the local brewpub and started coding,
producing a handful of snapshots along the way. This morning, a review
of the code you wrote last night makes you cringe a little bit. The code
is good overall, but you made a lot of mistakes early on that you
corrected in later snapshots.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say the branch on which you did your drunken development is called
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">drunk</span></tt> and you made three snapshots after you got home from the bar. If
the name <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">drunk</span></tt> points at the latest snapshot on that branch, then you
can use a useful notation to refer to the parent of that snapshot. The
notation <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">drunk^</span></tt> means the parent of the snapshot pointed to by
the branch name <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">drunk</span></tt>. Similarly <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">drunk^^</span></tt> means the
grandparent of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">drunk</span></tt> snapshot. So the three snapshots in
chronological order are <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">drunk^^</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">drunk^</span></tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">drunk</span></tt>.</p>
<img alt="_images/gp-drunk-parents.png" src="_images/gp-drunk-parents.png" />
<p>You&#8217;d really like those three lousy snapshots to be two clean snapshots.
One that changes an existing function, and one that adds a new file. To
accomplish this revision of history you copy <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">drunk</span></tt> to &#8216;working&#8217; and
delete the file that is new in the series. Now &#8216;working&#8217; represents the
correct modifications to the existing function. You create a new
snapshot from &#8216;working&#8217; and write the message to be appropriate to the
changes. For the parent you specify the SHA1 of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">drunk^^^</span></tt> snapshot,
essentially creating a new branch off of the same snapshot as last night.</p>
<img alt="_images/gp-drunk-rewrite.png" src="_images/gp-drunk-rewrite.png" />
<p>Now you can copy <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">drunk</span></tt> to &#8216;working&#8217; and roll a snapshot with the new file
addition. As the parent you specify that snapshot you created just before this
one.</p>
<p>As the last step, you change the branch name <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">drunk</span></tt> to point to the last
snapshot you just made.</p>

<p>The history of the &#8216;drunk&#8217; branch now represents a nicer version of what
you did last night. The other snapshots that you&#8217;ve replaced are no
longer needed so you can delete them or just leave them around for
posterity. No branch names are currently pointing at them so it will be
hard to find them later on, but if you don&#8217;t delete them, they&#8217;ll stick
around.</p>

<h2>Staging Area<a class="headerlink" href="#staging-area" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As much as you try to keep your new modifications related to a single
feature or logical chunk, you sometimes get sidetracked and start
hacking on something totally unrelated. Only half-way into this do you
realize that your working directory now contains what should really be
separated as two discrete snapshots.</p>
<img alt="_images/gp-two-changes.png" src="_images/gp-two-changes.png" />
<p>To help you with this annoying situation, the concept of a staging
directory is useful. This area acts as an intermediate step between your
working directory and a final snapshot. Each time you finish a snapshot,
you also copy that to a staging directory.</p>
<p>Copy first change to staging area:</p>
<img alt="_images/gp-change-one.png" src="_images/gp-change-one.png" />
<p>Copy staging area to first new snapshot:</p>
<img alt="_images/gp-to-staging1.png" src="_images/gp-to-staging1.png" />
<p>Copy second change to staging area:</p>
<img alt="_images/gp-change-two.png" src="_images/gp-change-two.png" />
<p>Copy staging area to second new snapshot:</p>
<img alt="_images/gp-to-staging2.png" src="_images/gp-to-staging2.png" />
<p>Now, every time you finish an edit to a new file, create a new file, or remove
a file, you can decide whether that change should be part of your next
snapshot. If it belongs, you mimic the change inside staging. If it doesn&#8217;t,
you can leave it in working and make it part of a later snapshot. From now on,
snapshots are created directly from the staging directory.</p>
<p>This separation of coding and preparing the stage makes it easy to
specify what is and is not included in the next snapshot. You no longer
have to worry too much about making an accidental, unrelated change in
your working directory.</p>
<p>You have to be a bit careful, though. Consider a file named README. You
make an edit to this file and then mimic that in staging. You go on
about your business, editing other files. After a bit, you make another
change to README. Now you have made two changes to that file, but only
one is in the staging area! Were you to create a snapshot now, your
second change would be absent.</p>
<p>The lesson is this: every new edit must be added to the staging area if
it is to be part of the next snapshot.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="diffs">
<h2>Diffs<a class="headerlink" href="#diffs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>With a working directory, a staging area, and loads of snapshots laying
around, it starts to get confusing as to what the specific code changes
are between these directories. A snapshot message only gives you a
summary of what changed, not exactly what lines were changed between two
files.</p>
<p>Using a diffing algorithm, you can implement a small program that shows
you the differences in two codebases. As you develop and copy things
from your working directory to the staging area, you&#8217;ll want to easily
see what is different between the two, so that you can determine what
else needs to be staged. It&#8217;s also important to see how the staging area
is different from the last snapshot, since these changes are what will
become part of the next snapshot you produce.</p>
<p>There are many other diffs you might want to see. The differences
between a specific snapshot and its parent would show you the
“changeset” that was introduced by that snapshot. The diff between two
branches would be helpful for making sure your development doesn&#8217;t
wander too far away from the mainline.</p>

<div class="section" id="eliminating-duplication">
<h2>Eliminating Duplication<a class="headerlink" href="#eliminating-duplication" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>After a few more trips to Namibia, Istanbul, and Galapagos, Zoe starts
to complain that her hard drive is filling up with hundreds of nearly
identical copies of the software. You too have been feeling like all the
file duplication is wasteful. After a bit of thinking, you come up with
something very clever.</p>
<p>You remember that the SHA1 hash produces a short string that is unique
for a given file contents. Starting with the very first snapshot in the
project history, you start a conversion process. First, you create a
directory named objects outside of the code history. Next, you find the
most deeply nested directory in the snapshot. Additionally, you open up
a temporary file for writing. For each file in this directory you
perform three steps. Step 1: Calculate the SHA1 of the contents. Step 2:
Add an entry into the temp file that contains the word &#8216;blob&#8217; (binary
large object), the SHA1 from the first step, and the filename. Step 3:
Copy the file to the objects directory and rename it to the SHA1 from
step 1. Once finished with all the files, find the SHA1 of the temp file
contents and use that to name the temp file, also placing it in the
objects directory.</p>
<p>If at any time the objects directory already contains a file with a
given name, then you have already stored that file&#8217;s contents and there
is no need to do so again.</p>
<p>Now, move up one directory and start over. Only this time, when you get
to the entry for the directory that you just processed, enter the word
&#8216;tree&#8217;, the SHA1 of the temp file from last time, and the directory&#8217;s
name into the new temp file. In this fashion you can build up a tree of
directory object files that contain the SHA1s and names of the files and
directory objects that they contain.</p>
<p>Once this has been accomplished for every directory and file in the
snapshot, you have a single root directory object file and its
corresponding SHA1. Since nothing contains the root directory, you must
record the root tree&#8217;s SHA1 somewhere. An ideal place to store it is in
the snapshot message file. This way, the uniqueness of the SHA1 of the
message also depends on the entire contents of the snapshot, and you can
guarantee with absolute certainty that two identical snapshot message
SHA1s contain the same files!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also convenient to create an object from the snapshot message in
the same way that you do for blobs and trees. Since you&#8217;re maintaining a
list of branch and tag names that point to message SHA1s you don&#8217;t have
to worry about losing track of which snapshots are important to you.</p>
<p>With all of this information stored in the objects directory, you can
safely delete the snapshot directory that you used as the source of this
operation. If you want to reconstitute the snapshot at a later date it&#8217;s
simply a matter of following the SHA1 of the root tree stored in the
message file and extracting each tree and blob into their corresponding
directory and file.</p>
<p>For a single snapshot, this transformation process doesn&#8217;t get you much.
You&#8217;ve basically just converted one filesystem into another and created
a lot of work in the process. The real benefits of this system arise
from reuse of trees and blobs across snapshots. Imagine two sequential
snapshots in which only a single file in the root directory has changed.
If the snapshots both contain 10 directories and 100 files, the
transformation process will create 10 trees and 100 blobs from the first
snapshot but only one new blob and one new tree from the second
snapshot!</p>
<p>By converting every snapshot directory in the old system to object files
in the new system, you can drastically reduce the number of files that
are stored on disk. Now, instead of storing perhaps 50 identical copies
of a rarely changed file, you only need to keep one.</p>

<div class="section" id="compressing-blobs">
<h2>Compressing Blobs<a class="headerlink" href="#compressing-blobs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Eliminating blob and tree duplication significantly reduces the total
storage size of your project history, but that&#8217;s not the only thing you
can do to save space. Source code is just text. Text can be very
efficiently compressed using something like the LZW or DEFLATE
compression algorithms. If you compress every blob before computing its
SHA1 and saving it to disk you can reduce the total storage size of the
project history by another very admirable quantity.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-true-git">
<h2>The True Git<a class="headerlink" href="#the-true-git" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The VCS you have constructed is now a reasonable facsimile of Git. The
main difference is that Git gives you very nice command lines tools to
handle such things as creating new snapshots and switching to old ones
(Git uses the term “commit” instead of “snapshot”), tracing history,
keeping branch tips up-to-date, fetching changes from other people,
merging and diffing branches, and hundreds of other common (and
not-so-common tasks).</p>
<p>As you continue to learn Git, keep this parable in mind. Git is really
very simple underneath, and it is this simplicity that makes it so
flexible and powerful. One last thing before you run off to learn all
the Git commands: remember that it is almost impossible to lose work
that has been committed. Even when you delete a branch, all that&#8217;s
really happened is that the pointer to that commit has been removed. All
of the snapshots are still in the objects directory, you just need to
dig up the commit SHA. In these cases, look up git reflog. It contains a
history of what each branch pointed to and in times of crisis, it will
save the day.</p>
<p>Here are some resources that you should follow as your next step. Now,
go, and become a Git master!</p>
