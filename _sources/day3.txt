We are going to start getting used to the `git`_ version control system this
week.

Git is an essential tool for anyone using code and data, and you will find
yourself using this tool all the time, so it is important to invest time
learning how to use git.

To use git, it is very important to understand the basic ideas behind it.

So, please read the :doc:`git_parable` |--| an excellent introduction to the
ideas behind git.  I've added some illustrations from :download:`slides from a
talk by Johan Herland <git_parable_johan_herland.pdf>` |--| I did not add some
of the later slides to our local copy of the git parable page, but you may well find them
useful for illustrating the last few sections of the git parable.
