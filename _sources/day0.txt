Quotes from David Donoho
************************

Donoho quote 0:

    "The scientific method’s central motivation is the ubiquity of error |--|
    the awareness that mistakes and self-delusion can creep in absolutely
    anywhere and that the scientist’s effort is primarily expended in
    recognizing and rooting out error." [donoho2009reproducible]_

Donoho quote 1:

    “In stark contrast to the sciences relying on deduction or empiricism,
    computational science is far less visibly concerned with the ubiquity of
    error. At conferences and in publications, it’s now completely acceptable
    for a researcher to simply say, ‘here is what I did, and here are my
    results.’ Presenters devote almost no time to explaining why the audience
    should believe that they found and corrected errors in their computations.
    The presentation’s core isn’t about the struggle to root out error — as it
    would be in mature fields — but is instead a sales pitch: an enthusiastic
    presentation of ideas and a breezy demo of an implementation. Computational
    science has nothing like the elaborate mechanisms of formal proof in
    mathematics or meta-analysis in empirical science. Many users of scientific
    computing aren’t even trying to follow a systematic, rigorous discipline
    that would in principle allow others to verify the claims they make. How
    dare we imagine that computational science, as routinely practiced, is
    reliable!” [donoho2009reproducible]_

Donoho quote 2:

    “In my own experience, error is ubiquitous in scientific computing, and one
    needs to work very diligently and energetically to eliminate it. One needs a
    very clear idea of what has been done in order to know where to look for
    likely sources of error. I often cannot really be sure what a student or
    colleague has done from his/her own presentation, and in fact often his/her
    description does not agree with my own understanding of what has been done,
    once I look carefully at the scripts. Actually, I find that researchers
    quite generally forget what they have done and misrepresent their
    computations.

    Computing results are now being presented in a very loose, “breezy” way—in
    journal articles, in conferences, and in books. All too often one simply
    takes computations at face value. This is spectacularly against the evidence
    of my own experience. I would much rather that at talks and in referee
    reports, the possibility of such error were seriously examined."
